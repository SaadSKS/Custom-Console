Thus, a layout element which has a flexible size specified but no preferred size will keep its minimum size until other layout elements have grown to their full preferred size, and only then begin to grow based on additional available space. By also specifying a flexible size, this can be avoided and the element can grow to its preferred size in tandem with the other layout elements that have preferred sizes, and then grow further once all flexible sizes have been allocated";
